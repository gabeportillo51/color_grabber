# color_grabber
Grab pixels from your display screen and save their color value in a color library.

Have you ever come across a color from a photo, video, or digital artwork that you really liked? Maybe you wanted to know what that color was so you could use it in your own designs.

The color grabber tool in this python code uses tkinter to create a GUI color library. You have the ability to point and click on any color on your display screen and add it to your library for further use.

The library stores the color info in RGB, Hexadecimal, CMYK, and HSL for all of your formatting needs.

Give it a try!
